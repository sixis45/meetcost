<p>
  Every meeting has a price tag. Not the conference room booking or the coffee — the <strong>salary cost
  of every person sitting in that room</strong>, doing nothing else. Most companies have no idea what
  that number is. When they find out, it's uncomfortable.
</p>

<h2>The Basic Meeting Cost Formula</h2>

<p>
  Meeting cost = <strong>Number of attendees × Average hourly rate × Duration in hours</strong>.
  That's it. Simple multiplication that almost nobody does.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what it looks like in practice. An employee earning $80,000 per year has a fully-loaded hourly
  cost of roughly $50/hour (including benefits, overhead, and taxes — typically 1.25-1.4× base salary).
  Put 6 of those employees in a room for 1 hour and the meeting costs <strong>$300</strong>. Do that
  twice a week and you're spending <strong>$28,800 per year</strong> on a single recurring meeting.

<h2>Where the Money Actually Goes</h2>

<p>
  Research from various workplace studies consistently finds that the average professional spends
  between 25-35% of their working hours in meetings. For managers, it's often 50% or more. Senior
  executives can spend up to 70% of their time in meetings.
</p>

<p>
  That means for a mid-level employee earning $80,000, roughly <strong>$20,000-$28,000 of their annual
  salary</strong> goes to sitting in meetings. For a VP earning $200,000, it could be $100,000+
  worth of time — and that's before counting the opportunity cost of what they could have been doing instead.
</p>

<h2>The Hidden Multiplier: Context Switching</h2>

<p>
  The salary math is just the direct cost. Research on attention and productivity suggests that
  it takes an average of <strong>23 minutes to fully refocus</strong> after an interruption. Every
  meeting fragments someone's day, and those fragments have their own cost.
</p>

<p>
  A 30-minute meeting in the middle of a focused work block doesn't cost 30 minutes — it costs
  closer to 60-75 minutes when you account for preparation, context switching, and recovery time.
  This is why many engineers and designers report that a day with 3 scattered meetings feels like
  a day where they got nothing done.
</p>

<h2>Meeting Cost at Scale</h2>

<p>
  For a 100-person company with an average salary of $70,000 (~$44/hour fully loaded):
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily standup, 10 people, 15 min:</strong> ~$26,400/year</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly team sync, 8 people, 1 hour:</strong> ~$16,900/year</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly all-hands, 100 people, 1 hour:</strong> ~$52,800/year</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly 1-on-1s across org, ~50 meetings, 30 min each:</strong> ~$112,200/year</li>
</ul>

<p>
  That's over <strong>$200,000 per year</strong> on just four types of recurring meetings. Most companies
  have dozens more. When organizations actually audit their meeting costs, the total typically comes to
  15-25% of total payroll — often the largest hidden line item in the budget.
</p>

<h2>What To Do About It</h2>

<p>
  The goal isn't zero meetings — some meetings are genuinely valuable. The goal is <strong>making the
  cost visible</strong> so teams can make informed decisions. When someone sees that their weekly
  brainstorm costs $500 per session, they might decide to make it biweekly, reduce the invite list,
  or replace it with an async document.
</p>

<p>
  Start by calculating the cost of your top 5 recurring meetings using our
  <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a>. The numbers alone usually trigger the right conversations.
  Most teams find they can cut 20-30% of meeting time without losing anything meaningful.
</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Meetings aren't free. Every meeting is a budget decision — you're choosing to spend salary dollars
  on synchronous discussion instead of individual output. Sometimes that's the right call. But you
  can't make that call if you don't know the price. <a href="/">Calculate your meeting costs now</a>
  and see where the money is going.
