  title="Managers Spend 35 Hours/Week in Meetings. Here's What That Costs."

<p>
  If you're a middle manager, meetings aren't part of your job — they <em>are</em> your job.
  Research consistently shows that managers spend <strong>35+ hours per week</strong> in meetings,
  leaving fewer than 5 hours for the work those meetings are supposedly coordinating. For senior
  managers and directors, the number often exceeds 40 hours — meaning meetings alone consume
  more than a full workweek.
</p>

<p>
  Nobody calculates what this costs. They should.
</p>

<h2>The Dollar Cost of a Manager's Meeting Load</h2>

<p>
  A mid-level manager in the US earns a fully-loaded cost of roughly $75–$100/hour when you include
  salary, benefits, taxes, and overhead. At 35 hours of meetings per week, that's
  <strong>$2,625–$3,500 per week</strong> in meeting time alone — or
  <strong>$126,000–$168,000 per year</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  For a company with 30 managers at that level, the annual cost of manager meeting time is between
  <strong>$3.8 million and $5 million</strong>. That's not total compensation — that's just the
  portion of their salary consumed by sitting in meetings.
</p>

<p>
  A director or VP at $120–$150/hour spending the same 35 hours in meetings costs the company
  $200,000–$250,000/year in meeting time. And these are the people whose strategic thinking and
  decision-making the company is paying a premium for — except they have no time to actually do it.
</p>

<h2>Where the Hours Go</h2>

<p>
  A typical manager's weekly meeting breakdown looks something like this: 6–8 hours in 1:1s with
  direct reports, 3–5 hours in team meetings they lead, 5–8 hours in cross-functional syncs,
  3–5 hours in leadership/status meetings, 2–4 hours in ad-hoc "quick calls," and 4–6 hours in
  project-specific meetings. Each individual meeting seems reasonable. The aggregate is crushing.
</p>

<p>
  The particularly painful part is that managers are simultaneously the most expensive attendees
  (higher salaries) and the most over-invited. Because they sit at the intersection of teams,
  they get pulled into meetings from every direction. A manager who reports to one VP, leads a
  team of 8, and collaborates with 3 other teams can easily receive 40+ meeting invites per week.
</p>

<h2>The Cascading Cost</h2>

<p>
  When a manager is buried in meetings, the cost extends far beyond their salary. Their team slows
  down because decisions get delayed — the manager is in back-to-back calls and can't respond
  until 6 PM. Strategic work gets done on evenings and weekends, leading to burnout. And the
  manager starts "multitasking" in meetings (answering Slack, reading emails), which means
  they're paying the full cost of attendance while extracting a fraction of the value.
</p>

<p>
  Microsoft's research found that managers who are in meetings for more than 25 hours per week
  report significantly lower effectiveness scores. The irony is that the more meetings a manager
  attends, the less effective each meeting becomes — because they're too depleted to bring
  full attention to any of them.
</p>

<h2>What Actually Helps</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Audit ruthlessly.</strong> Take your last two weeks of meetings and categorize each one:
  did you actively contribute, or were you there "just in case"? Most managers find that 30–40%
  of their meetings don't require their presence. Declining those meetings or sending a delegate
  can recover 10+ hours per week.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Batch by type.</strong> Group all 1:1s into two blocks. Put cross-functional syncs on the
  same day. This reduces context-switching and creates longer uninterrupted blocks on other days.
  Some managers go further and designate two "meeting days" and three "maker days" each week.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Make your calendar public knowledge.</strong> When your team can see that you're booked
  35 hours, they stop wondering why you're slow to respond. Some managers share their weekly meeting
  time as a number in team standups — the transparency alone creates pressure to protect their time.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Default to shorter.</strong> Switch all 60-minute meetings to 45 minutes and all
  30-minute meetings to 25 minutes. At 35 meetings per week, saving 5–15 minutes each adds up
  to 3–8 recovered hours — nearly a full workday.
</p>

<h2>The Real Question</h2>

<p>
  If your company is paying a manager $150,000/year and 85% of their time goes to meetings,
  you're paying $127,500/year for someone to attend meetings and $22,500/year for actual management
  work. Is that the right allocation?
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/">Run the numbers for your own meeting load</a>. Then have an honest conversation with
  your manager about what should change.
