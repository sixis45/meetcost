<p>
  Companies obsess over ROI on software, marketing spend, and headcount. Nobody measures ROI on
  meetings — even though meetings are often the single largest line item in a team's time budget.
  A 50-person company at average US salaries spends <strong>$1.5–$2 million per year</strong> on
  meeting time. What's the return on that investment?
</p>

<p>
  Usually, nobody knows. Here's how to start figuring it out.
</p>

<h2>The Meeting ROI Formula</h2>

<p>
  Meeting ROI isn't complicated in theory. It's the value of the outcome divided by the cost of
  the meeting. The cost side is easy: people × hourly rate × duration. The value side is where
  things get interesting — and where most teams have never even tried.
</p>

<p>
  Not every meeting produces a measurable dollar outcome. But every meeting should produce
  <strong>something</strong>: a decision, a plan, an alignment, a solved problem. If you walk out
  of a meeting and can't name the output, the ROI was zero regardless of how productive it felt.
</p>

<h2>Three Categories of Meeting Value</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Decision meetings</strong> have the clearest ROI. If a 45-minute meeting with 4 people
  ($150 in labor) unblocks a $50,000 project that was stalled, the return is obvious. The key
  metric: was a decision actually made? If the meeting ended with "let's schedule a follow-up to
  decide," the ROI was negative — you paid for the meeting and still don't have the decision.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Information meetings</strong> — standups, all-hands, status updates — are harder to value.
  Their return is measured in alignment: did the information change anyone's behavior or prevent a
  mistake? If six people sat through a 30-minute update and none of them needed the information to
  do their job differently, the meeting cost money and returned nothing. This is the category where
  async communication almost always wins.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Relationship meetings</strong> — 1:1s, team building, retrospectives — have the most
  diffuse ROI. Their value shows up in retention, engagement, and trust, which are real but hard
  to attribute to any single meeting. The best proxy metric is whether people voluntarily attend
  and participate. If a weekly team retro has become a silent obligation, the relationship value
  has dropped to zero and you're paying full price for it.
</p>

<h2>The 48-Hour Test</h2>

<p>
  Here's a simple heuristic: 48 hours after a meeting, can anyone on the team name a specific
  action or decision that came from it? If the answer is no, the meeting didn't generate enough
  value to justify its cost. This test sounds harsh, but apply it to your last week of meetings
  and you'll find that 30–50% fail it.
</p>

<p>
  The meetings that pass tend to share common traits: they had a clear purpose going in, the right
  people were present (and no one else), and they ended with documented next steps. The meetings
  that fail are the ones that existed because they were already on the calendar.
</p>

<h2>Calculating ROI at the Team Level</h2>

<p>
  Instead of evaluating individual meetings, look at the portfolio. Add up the total meeting hours
  for your team in a given week. Multiply by average hourly rate. That's your weekly meeting investment.
</p>

<p>
  Now list the concrete outcomes those meetings produced: decisions made, blockers removed,
  conflicts resolved, plans created. Estimate the value of each — even roughly. A decision that
  unblocked three people for a week might be worth $5,000 in recovered productivity. A brainstorm
  that generated a viable product idea might be worth far more.
</p>

<p>
  If your team spends $3,000/week on meetings and can only attribute $1,500 in value to the outcomes,
  you know where to look. The gap isn't inevitable — it's a signal that half your meetings need to
  be restructured, shortened, or eliminated.
</p>

<h2>The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>

<p>
  Most meetings have negative ROI. Not because meetings are inherently bad, but because the
  default in most organizations is to schedule them without considering cost and to never
  evaluate whether they delivered. If you treated any other budget item this way — spending
  freely with no measurement — it would be flagged in the first quarterly review.

<p>
  <a href="/">Calculate your team's weekly meeting spend</a>, then ask: what did we get for that money?
  The answer usually starts an important conversation.
