<p>
  When you calculate meeting costs, the biggest mistake is using base salary. An employee earning
  $80,000 doesn't cost your company $80,000. The real number — the <strong>fully loaded cost</strong> — includes
  benefits, payroll taxes, equipment, office space, and overhead. It's typically <strong>1.25× to 1.4×
  base salary</strong>, sometimes higher.
</p>

<h2>What "Fully Loaded" Includes</h2>

<p>
  The fully loaded cost of an employee covers everything the company spends to keep that person
  working. Beyond gross salary, this includes employer-side payroll taxes (Social Security, Medicare,
  unemployment insurance), health insurance premiums, retirement contributions like 401(k) matching,
  paid time off, equipment and software licenses, office space per employee, training and development,
  and HR and administrative overhead.
</p>

<p>
  For a US-based employee earning $80,000 base salary, the breakdown typically looks something like
  this: payroll taxes add roughly $6,100, health insurance runs $6,000-$12,000 per year depending on
  plan type, 401(k) match adds $2,400-$4,000, PTO costs around $6,150 (accounting for the 15-20 days
  they're paid but not working), and equipment plus overhead adds another $3,000-$8,000. That pushes
  the total to roughly <strong>$100,000-$110,000</strong> — or about 1.3× the base salary.
</p>

<h2>Quick Multipliers by Role Type</h2>

<p>
  If you don't want to calculate every line item, use these multipliers as a reasonable estimate.
  For <strong>tech employees</strong> in the US (engineers, designers, PMs), use 1.3-1.4× due to
  higher benefits packages and expensive tooling. For <strong>general office workers</strong>,
  1.25-1.3× is typical. For <strong>European employees</strong>, use 1.3-1.5× since employer-side
  social contributions are generally higher. For <strong>contractors and freelancers</strong>, the
  multiplier is 1.0× — their rate is their rate, no additional overhead.
</p>

<h2>Converting to Hourly Rate</h2>

<p>
  To get the hourly rate for meeting cost calculations, take the fully loaded annual cost and divide
  by actual working hours per year. A standard year has 2,080 work hours (52 weeks × 40 hours), but
  after holidays and PTO, the real number is closer to <strong>1,880 hours</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  So an employee with a fully loaded cost of $104,000 has a true hourly cost of about <strong>$55/hour</strong>.
  That's the number you should plug into a <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a> — not the
  $38/hour you'd get from dividing their base salary by 2,080.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters for Meeting Costs</h2>

<p>
  Using base salary instead of fully loaded cost understates your meeting expenses by 25-40%.
  A weekly 1-hour meeting with 8 people at $38/hour (base) looks like $14,600/year. At $55/hour
  (fully loaded), it's <strong>$21,100/year</strong> — a $6,500 difference from one meeting.
  Across all your recurring meetings, the gap adds up to tens of thousands.
</p>

<p>
  The fully loaded rate is the economically honest number. It represents the actual resources consumed
  when a person sits in a meeting instead of doing other work. Use our <a href="/">meeting cost
  calculator</a> with the fully loaded rate to see what your meetings actually cost.
