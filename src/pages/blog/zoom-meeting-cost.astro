  title="The True Cost of Zoom Meetings: It's Not Just the Subscription"
  description="Zoom costs $13-22/month per user. But the salary cost of time spent in Zoom meetings dwarfs the software bill by 100×."

<p>
  Companies carefully evaluate whether to pay $13 or $22 per month for Zoom licenses. Meanwhile,
  they spend <strong>100-500× that amount</strong> on the salary cost of the people sitting in those
  Zoom calls — without a second thought. The software is a rounding error. The human time is where
  the real money goes.
</p>

<h2>Software Cost vs. People Cost</h2>

<p>
  A Zoom Pro license costs roughly $13/month per user. For a 50-person company, that's $7,800/year.
  Now consider the meeting time: if the average employee spends 12 hours per week on Zoom calls
  at a fully loaded cost of $50/hour, that's $600/week per person, or <strong>$1.44 million per
  year</strong> across the company. The Zoom license is 0.5% of the actual meeting cost.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  This isn't a criticism of Zoom — it's a useful tool. But it illustrates how companies obsess over
  software costs while ignoring the dramatically larger cost of how those tools are used. Saving
  $5,000 by downgrading a Zoom plan while wasting $200,000 on unnecessary meetings is optimizing
  the wrong variable.
</p>

<h2>Remote Meetings Are Easier to Schedule (and That's a Problem)</h2>

<p>
  Before remote work, scheduling a meeting had natural friction: booking a conference room, finding
  a time when everyone could physically be in the same place, walking between buildings. Remote
  tools removed all of that friction. Now scheduling a meeting is as easy as clicking "New Meeting"
  and selecting time slots.
</p>

<p>
  Research on remote and hybrid work patterns has found that the number of meetings per person
  increased significantly after the shift to remote work. Meetings got shorter on average, but
  their frequency more than compensated. The net result: people spend as much or more time in
  meetings than before, spread across a larger number of shorter calls.
</p>

<h2>Zoom Fatigue Has a Dollar Value</h2>

<p>
  "Zoom fatigue" isn't just a feeling — research from Stanford and other institutions has documented
  the cognitive toll of video calls. The constant self-view, the reduced nonverbal cues, the
  processing overhead of multiple faces on a grid — all of it adds cognitive load that doesn't
  exist in person or on a phone call.
</p>

<p>
  This fatigue translates to reduced productivity after video meetings compared to after in-person
  meetings or phone calls. If video meetings increase the effective context-switching recovery time
  by even 5 minutes per meeting, that's a meaningful cost across an organization. For a 50-person
  company with 200 meetings per week, an extra 5 minutes of recovery per meeting is
  <strong>867 additional hours per year</strong> of reduced productivity.
</p>

<h2>Practical Fixes</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Default to cameras off</strong> for status updates and routine syncs. Camera-on is
  valuable for relationship building and sensitive discussions, but it's unnecessary for reviewing
  a dashboard or hearing a project update. Camera-off meetings report less fatigue.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Use phone calls for 1-on-1s.</strong> A walking phone call is less fatiguing, allows
  physical movement, and works just as well for most conversations that don't require screen sharing.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Replace recurring video meetings with async video.</strong> Tools like Loom let someone
  record a 5-minute update that the team watches at their own pace. It replaces a 30-minute
  synchronous meeting with 5 minutes of asynchronous consumption — and people retain more
  information because they can pause and replay.

  Start by calculating what your Zoom meetings actually cost in salary time using our
  <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a>. Compare it to your Zoom subscription. The ratio will
  make it very clear where to focus your optimization efforts.
