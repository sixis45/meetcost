<p>
  Tell someone their weekly team meeting costs $19,000 per year and they'll nod thoughtfully.
  Show them a live counter ticking up at <strong>$8.33 per minute</strong> while they sit in that
  meeting, and they'll suddenly find ways to end it 15 minutes early.
</p>

<p>
  The information is identical. The psychological impact is completely different.
</p>

<h2>Why Per-Minute Cost Works</h2>

<p>
  Annual meeting costs are abstract numbers. They're too large, too distant, and too disconnected
  from the moment to change behavior. Nobody walks into a meeting thinking "this is costing us
  $19,000 per year." The number lives in a spreadsheet somewhere and gets forgotten.
</p>

<p>
  Per-minute cost is different. It's immediate. It creates what behavioral economists call
  a <strong>pain of paying</strong> — the same psychological mechanism that makes people spend less
  when they pay with cash instead of credit cards. Watching money leave in real time hurts more
  than knowing it left in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
  A 10-person meeting at $50/hour average costs $8.33 per minute. That's $500 per hour. Every minute
  someone spends on a tangent, every late arrival that delays the start, every "let me share my screen...
  hang on... sorry, one second" — they all have a visible price tag.
</p>

<h2>The Live Timer Effect</h2>

<p>
  Companies that display real-time meeting costs report consistent behavior changes. Meeting
  organizers become more aggressive about starting on time because they can see the meter running
  during the 3-minute wait for stragglers. At $8/minute with 10 people, a 3-minute late start
  costs $25. Trivial in isolation, but it happens 5 times a week across 20 meetings — that's
  $12,000/year wasted on waiting.
</p>

<p>
  Participants self-edit. The person who usually goes on a 5-minute tangent about their weekend
  reconsiders when the cost counter is visible. The group collectively becomes less tolerant of
  off-topic discussion — not because anyone is rude about it, but because the cost makes the
  trade-off visible.
</p>

<p>
  Meetings end earlier. When the primary agenda items are resolved at the 20-minute mark of a
  30-minute meeting, groups with a visible cost counter are far more likely to end early than
  groups without one. Without the counter, those 10 minutes fill with "anything else?" small talk
  that no one values but everyone tolerates.
</p>

<h2>Calculating Your Burn Rate</h2>

<p>
  The formula is simple: <strong>(number of attendees × average hourly rate) ÷ 60 = cost per minute</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what common meeting configurations cost per minute:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>4-person team sync at $50/hr:</strong> $3.33/min → $83 for a 25-min meeting<br/>
  <strong>8-person cross-functional at $55/hr:</strong> $7.33/min → $367 for a 50-min meeting<br/>
  <strong>15-person all-hands at $50/hr:</strong> $12.50/min → $625 for a 50-min meeting<br/>
  <strong>6-person leadership meeting at $90/hr:</strong> $9.00/min → $225 for a 25-min meeting
</p>

<p>
  That leadership meeting burns through $9 every 60 seconds. If the VP spends 2 minutes searching
  for the right slide, that fumble just cost the company $18. Small numbers individually. Massive
  in aggregate.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This</h2>

<p>
  The easiest implementation is our <a href="/">Live Timer mode</a>. Start it when the meeting
  begins and share your screen or put it on the conference room display. You don't need to say
  anything about it — the number does the talking.
</p>

<p>
  Some teams take it further and include the per-minute cost in meeting invites: "This meeting
  costs $7.50/minute. Please arrive on time and prepared." It sounds aggressive on paper, but
  in practice, people appreciate the transparency. It reframes the meeting from "free time" to
  "budget allocation" — which is what it actually is.
</p>

<p>
  After the meeting, <a href="/">generate a cost report</a> and share it with the team. The first
  time people see "This 47-minute meeting cost $392" attached to a specific meeting they just sat
  through, the relationship between time and money becomes permanently real.
