<p>
  One-on-one meetings are a strange paradox. Per attendee, they're the most expensive meeting format
  in your calendar. A weekly 30-minute 1:1 between a manager earning $70/hour and a direct report
  at $45/hour costs <strong>$2,760 per year</strong>. A manager with 8 direct reports? That's
  <strong>$22,080 per year</strong> — just on 1:1s.
</p>

<p>
  And yet, unlike most meetings, cutting them is almost always the wrong move.
</p>

<h2>The Math Behind One-on-Ones</h2>

<p>
  The formula is straightforward: (manager hourly rate + report hourly rate) × duration × frequency × 48 weeks.
  But the numbers get interesting when you look at them in context.
</p>

<p>
  A 30-minute weekly 1:1 at an average combined rate of $100/hour costs $2,400/year. A 60-minute
  weekly 1:1 doubles that to $4,800/year. For a VP with 6 directors reporting to them, each earning
  $80+/hour, the annual 1:1 cost easily exceeds $30,000.
</p>

<p>
  Now multiply across the org. A 200-person company where every manager holds weekly 1:1s with their
  reports — assuming an average span of 6 directs — spends roughly <strong>$150,000–$200,000 per year</strong>
  on one-on-one meetings alone.
</p>

<h2>Why Cutting One-on-Ones Backfires</h2>

<p>
  When companies look to reduce meeting costs, 1:1s often seem like easy targets. They're recurring,
  they're frequent, and half the time someone says "I don't really have anything this week."
  But the research tells a different story.
</p>

<p>
  Gallup's engagement data consistently shows that employees who have regular 1:1s with their
  manager are <strong>3× more likely to be engaged</strong> at work. Disengaged employees cost companies
  an estimated 18% of their annual salary in lost productivity. For a $70,000 employee, that's $12,600 —
  five times the annual cost of a weekly 30-minute 1:1.
</p>

<p>
  The real cost of canceling 1:1s isn't the time you save. It's the problems that go undetected for weeks,
  the misalignment that compounds, and the resignation letter you didn't see coming because you stopped
  checking in.
</p>

<h2>How to Make One-on-Ones Worth Their Cost</h2>

<p>
  The issue with most 1:1s isn't that they exist — it's that they're poorly run. A 1:1 that's just a
  status update is a waste. That information belongs in a project tool or async check-in. The expensive
  time you're paying for should go toward things only a synchronous conversation can accomplish.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Use a shared doc.</strong> Both parties add topics before the meeting. If neither person has
  anything substantive, cancel that week's session guilt-free. You've just saved the cost without
  losing the relationship.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Keep them to 25 minutes.</strong> The default 30-minute slot encourages filler. A 25-minute
  meeting forces focus and gives everyone a 5-minute buffer before their next commitment. Over a year,
  that 5-minute reduction saves your team dozens of hours.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Separate status from coaching.</strong> If you're spending 1:1 time reviewing task lists,
  you're paying senior rates for information that belongs in Jira. Reserve the face time for career
  development, blockers, feedback, and the kind of nuanced conversation that can't happen in a Slack message.
</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  One-on-ones are expensive. A mid-size company easily spends six figures on them annually.
  But they're one of the few meeting types where the ROI is well-documented — engaged employees
  perform better, stay longer, and create less costly churn.
</p>

<p>
  The goal isn't to eliminate them. It's to make every minute count.
