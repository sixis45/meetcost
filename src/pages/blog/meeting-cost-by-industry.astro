  title="Meeting Costs by Industry: Tech, Finance, Healthcare & More"
  description="Meeting costs vary wildly by industry. A 1-hour meeting in finance costs 2× what it costs in education. Here's the breakdown."

<p>
  Not all meetings cost the same. A one-hour meeting with 6 people in investment banking costs
  roughly <strong>$900</strong>. The same meeting in education costs around <strong>$270</strong>.
  The math is identical — people × rate × time — but the inputs are dramatically different across
  industries.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what meetings actually cost in the sectors where people complain about them most.
</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>
  Average fully-loaded hourly rate for a tech employee in the US sits around $75–$95/hour when you
  factor in salary, benefits, equity, and overhead. A typical "sync" — 6 engineers in a 1-hour
  meeting — costs between <strong>$450 and $570</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  But the direct salary cost understates the problem in tech. Engineers and designers rely on
  uninterrupted focus blocks, and meetings fragment those blocks in ways that
  <a href="/blog/context-switching-cost-meetings">multiply the real cost</a> well beyond the
  time spent in the room.
</p>

<p>
  Tech companies also hold more meetings than they think. The average software engineer at a
  mid-to-large company spends 10–15 hours per week in meetings, which translates to roughly
  <strong>$35,000–$70,000 per engineer per year</strong> in meeting time alone.
</p>

<h2>Financial Services</h2>

<p>
  Finance operates at some of the highest hourly rates of any sector. A managing director at an
  investment bank has a fully-loaded cost north of $200/hour. Even mid-level analysts sit around
  $80–$120/hour. A weekly team meeting with 8 people across seniority levels can easily run
  <strong>$800–$1,200 per session</strong>, or <strong>$40,000–$58,000 per year</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The irony is that finance also has some of the most meeting-heavy cultures. Deal reviews, risk
  committees, compliance briefings — many are regulatory requirements that can't simply be eliminated.
  The lever in finance isn't fewer meetings. It's fewer attendees per meeting and shorter durations.
</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>
  Healthcare is a split market. Administrative staff meetings run at $30–$50/hour per person — reasonable.
  But pull a surgeon ($150+/hour), two specialists ($100+/hour), and a department head into a room for a
  case conference, and you're looking at <strong>$500+ per hour</strong> for a single meeting.
</p>

<p>
  The unique challenge in healthcare is that many meetings have direct patient-safety justifications.
  Handoffs, multidisciplinary rounds, and safety huddles save lives. The waste comes from administrative
  meetings that bloat into the clinical calendar — committee meetings, EMR training sessions, and
  bureaucratic reviews that could be handled asynchronously.
</p>

<h2>Consulting & Professional Services</h2>

<p>
  Consultants understand meeting costs intuitively because their entire business model is based on
  billable hours. A partner at a major firm bills at $500–$800/hour. When four consultants and three
  client stakeholders sit in a two-hour alignment meeting, the combined salary cost
  (not billing rate — just what the firm pays in labor) is easily <strong>$1,000+</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Consulting firms are some of the most disciplined about meeting efficiency because every
  unproductive hour is directly visible on a timesheet. The lesson for other industries: if you tracked
  meeting time the way consultants track billable hours, you'd cut 30% of your meetings overnight.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>
  Teachers and administrators are among the lowest-paid professionals who attend the most meetings.
  At $25–$45/hour fully loaded, a 1-hour department meeting with 10 teachers costs $250–$450.
  The dollar figure is modest compared to finance or tech, but the <strong>opportunity cost</strong>
  is enormous — every hour in a meeting is an hour not spent on lesson planning, grading, or student
  interaction.
</p>

<p>
  Schools are also notoriously bad at distinguishing between meetings that need real-time discussion
  and information that could be an email. A weekly all-staff meeting at a school with 60 teachers
  costs roughly <strong>$2,000 per session</strong> in labor. If even half of those sessions could be
  replaced with a written update, that's $48,000/year redirected to actual education.
</p>

<h2>The Universal Pattern</h2>

<p>
  Regardless of industry, the pattern is the same: organizations underestimate meeting costs because
  they never calculate them. The hourly rate changes, but the waste mechanisms — too many attendees,
  too-long durations, meetings that should be async — are identical whether you're in a hospital,
  a hedge fund, or a classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/">Calculate your industry's meeting costs</a> with real hourly rates. The number is
  probably higher than you think.
