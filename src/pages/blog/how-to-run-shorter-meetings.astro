  title="How to Run 25-Minute Meetings (And Why 30 Minutes Is Too Long)"
  description="The default 30-minute meeting slot is arbitrary and wasteful. Here's how to run 25-minute meetings that accomplish more in less time."

<p>
  The 30-minute meeting is an accident of calendar software, not a reflection of how long
  decisions actually take. Most 30-minute meetings contain 15-20 minutes of substance and
  10-15 minutes of filler — late starts, preamble, tangents, and "any other business" that
  nobody prepared for.
</p>

<p>
  Switching to 25-minute defaults doesn't sound like much. But for a team of 8 people with
  15 meetings per week, those 5 minutes per meeting save <strong>65 hours per year</strong>
  in collective time. At $50/hour, that's $3,250 — from changing a single calendar setting.
</p>

<h2>Why 25 Minutes Works</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Parkinson's Law is real.</strong> Work expands to fill the time available. A discussion
  that would take 15 minutes in a 25-minute slot takes 28 minutes in a 30-minute slot. The
  extra time doesn't produce extra value — it produces extra words. Tighter time boxes force
  participants to get to the point faster.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The 5-minute buffer matters.</strong> Back-to-back 30-minute meetings mean zero
  transition time. People arrive late to meeting #2 because meeting #1 ran to :30. The 25-minute
  meeting builds in a natural break — 5 minutes to stand up, check messages, mentally shift
  contexts, and arrive on time for the next commitment. Google calls this "speedy meetings" and
  it's been their default for years.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Shorter meetings command more respect.</strong> When someone sees a 25-minute meeting
  on their calendar, it signals that the organizer is conscious of their time. Attendance and
  punctuality tend to be better for shorter meetings because the implicit message is "we're not
  going to waste your time."
</p>

<h2>The Tactical Playbook</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Set your calendar to default 25/50 minutes.</strong> In Google Calendar: Settings →
  Event Settings → Default duration → change 30 to 25, change 60 to 50. In Outlook: File →
  Options → Calendar → Shorten appointments and meetings. One change, permanent effect.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Start with the decision, not the context.</strong> The biggest time sink in meetings
  is someone spending 10 minutes "providing context" before getting to the point. Flip the order.
  Start with "We need to decide X. Here are the two options. Who has a strong view?" Context
  can fill in as needed during the discussion.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Assign a timekeeper.</strong> Not the meeting organizer — they're too busy facilitating.
  Give someone the explicit role of watching the clock and announcing "5 minutes left" and
  "1 minute left." This simple role prevents the slow drift that turns 25 minutes into 35.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>End with 2 minutes of documentation.</strong> Reserve the last 2 minutes for someone
  to read back the decisions and action items. This takes 90 seconds and prevents the most
  expensive meeting outcome: having the same meeting again next week because nobody wrote down
  what was decided.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Kill "any other business."</strong> AOB is where meetings go to die. If something isn't
  important enough to make the agenda, it isn't important enough to cost 6 people their time.
  Replace AOB with a post-meeting Slack thread: "Anything we didn't cover? Drop it here."
</p>

<h2>The 15-Minute Meeting</h2>

<p>
  Some meetings don't even need 25 minutes. Quick decisions, brief check-ins, and simple approvals
  can often be handled in 15 minutes. The trick is being honest about which meetings fall into this
  category. If a meeting has one agenda item and involves fewer than 4 people, try 15 minutes first.
  You can always schedule a follow-up if you need more time — but you rarely will.
</p>

<p>
  At scale, the impact is real. If a 50-person company shortens an average of 20 meetings per week
  by 10 minutes each, that's <strong>167 hours of recovered time per month</strong>. At $50/hour,
  that's nearly <strong>$100,000 per year</strong> — from meetings that still happen, just faster.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/">Run the calculator</a> with your current meeting durations, then again with durations
  cut by 5-10 minutes. The annual difference is your incentive to change the default.
