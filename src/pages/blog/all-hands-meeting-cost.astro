<p>
  No meeting on your calendar costs more per session than the all-hands. When you put your
  entire company in a room — or a Zoom — the meter runs fast. A 200-person company at $50/hour
  average burns through <strong>$10,000 per hour</strong>. A monthly 1-hour all-hands at that
  rate costs <strong>$120,000 per year</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  For some companies, that's money well spent. For others, it's the most expensive broadcast
  email in history.
</p>

<h2>The Cost at Different Sizes</h2>

<p>
  The math is brutal because every additional employee multiplies the cost linearly while often
  adding zero to the discussion.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>50 people, $50/hr avg, 1 hour monthly:</strong> $2,500/session → $30,000/year<br/>
  <strong>100 people, $50/hr avg, 1 hour monthly:</strong> $5,000/session → $60,000/year<br/>
  <strong>200 people, $55/hr avg, 1 hour monthly:</strong> $11,000/session → $132,000/year<br/>
  <strong>500 people, $55/hr avg, 1 hour monthly:</strong> $27,500/session → $330,000/year<br/>
  <strong>1,000 people, $50/hr avg, 1 hour biweekly:</strong> $50,000/session → $1.2 million/year
</p>

<p>
  At enterprise scale, the all-hands is a seven-figure line item. And unlike most expenses of
  that size, nobody signs a purchase order for it.
</p>

<h2>What the All-Hands Is Actually For</h2>

<p>
  The all-hands serves purposes that no other meeting format can replicate — but only if you
  use it for those purposes. There are three things that genuinely require the whole company
  in one room.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Strategic alignment.</strong> When leadership needs to communicate direction, priorities,
  or major changes in a way that ensures everyone hears the same message at the same time. This
  prevents the telephone game of information cascading through managers, each adding their own spin.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cultural reinforcement.</strong> Celebrating wins, recognizing people, reinforcing values —
  these have more impact when the whole company witnesses them. A Slack message saying "congrats
  to the sales team" doesn't carry the same weight as the CEO saying it in front of 200 people.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Two-way communication at scale.</strong> Q&A sessions where anyone can ask leadership a
  direct question. This is one of the few mechanisms that gives individual contributors a voice in
  front of the whole organization and holds leadership accountable in real time.
</p>

<h2>What Doesn't Belong in an All-Hands</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Department updates.</strong> "Here's what marketing did this month. Now here's what
  engineering did." This is the single biggest time-waster in all-hands meetings. Most people
  don't need most departments' updates, and the ones they do need can be delivered faster in
  writing. If your all-hands is 45 minutes of department presentations and 15 minutes of Q&A,
  the ratio is backwards.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Metrics reviews.</strong> Reading numbers from a dashboard that everyone can access
  themselves is not a good use of 200 people's time. Share the dashboard link in advance. Use
  the all-hands to discuss what the numbers <em>mean</em> and what you're doing about them —
  that's the part that requires leadership's voice.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Announcements that could be an email.</strong> Policy changes, process updates, tool
  migrations — these don't need 200 people listening in real time. Write it down, send it out,
  and reserve the all-hands for the questions that come back.
</p>

<h2>The Efficient All-Hands Format</h2>

<p>
  The highest-ROI all-hands structure inverts the typical format. Instead of 45 minutes of
  presentations and 15 minutes of Q&A, try: <strong>10 minutes of strategic context from the
  CEO</strong> (what's changed, where we're headed, what matters most right now),
  <strong>10 minutes of spotlight</strong> (recognition, one team deep-dive that's genuinely
  interesting to everyone), and <strong>25 minutes of open Q&A</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The Q&A is where the real value lives. It's the one format where individual contributors
  can surface concerns, ask hard questions, and hear unscripted answers. Companies that protect
  this time report higher employee trust and engagement scores.
</p>

<p>
  Total: 45 minutes instead of 60. For a 200-person company, that 15-minute reduction saves
  $33,000 per year. And the meeting is better because the content that fills those 15 minutes
  — department updates nobody listens to — was the lowest-value part anyway.
</p>

<h2>Should You Even Have One?</h2>

<p>
  For companies under 20 people, you probably don't need a formal all-hands. Everyone's already
  in the loop through daily interaction. For 20-100, a monthly all-hands is valuable if it's
  well-run. Above 100, the cost is high enough that every minute must be intentional.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/">Calculate what your all-hands costs per session</a>. If the number makes you
  uncomfortable, that's good — it means you'll start treating it like the premium event it is.
