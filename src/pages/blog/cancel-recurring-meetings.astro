<p>
  Every organization accumulates recurring meetings like barnacles on a ship. They start with good
  intentions, become habits, and eventually persist long after their original purpose has expired.
  The average team has 3-5 recurring meetings that no longer justify their cost. Here's how to
  identify them and build the case for cancellation.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Audit Your Recurring Meetings</h2>

<p>
  List every recurring meeting your team holds. For each one, calculate the cost using our
  <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a> — people × fully loaded hourly rate × duration × frequency.
  Then multiply by 48 working weeks to get the annual cost. Most teams are shocked when they see
  the total. A team of 8 with five recurring weekly meetings averaging 45 minutes each at $50/hour
  is spending roughly <strong>$144,000 per year</strong> on those five meetings alone.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Score Each Meeting</h2>

<p>
  For each recurring meeting, ask the team to score it on three criteria. First, <strong>does this
  meeting produce a clear output?</strong> A decision, an action item list, a resolved blocker —
  something tangible. Meetings that consistently end without a concrete outcome are candidates for
  cancellation. Second, <strong>does everyone in the room need to be there?</strong> If half the
  attendees are passive listeners, either reduce the invite list or replace the meeting with a
  written summary. Third, <strong>would anything break if we skipped it for two weeks?</strong>
  This is the most revealing test. If the answer is "probably not," the meeting isn't critical.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Build the Business Case</h2>

<p>
  Presenting "I think we have too many meetings" gets nods and no action. Presenting "we're spending
  $144,000 per year on five recurring meetings, and here's evidence that two of them aren't producing
  value" gets results. The key elements of a persuasive case:
</p>

<p>
  Lead with the <strong>total annual cost</strong> of the meetings you're proposing to cut. Frame it
  in relatable terms — "this is equivalent to one junior hire" or "this would fund our Q3 tooling
  budget." Then show the <strong>scoring results</strong> for each meeting. If the team rated a
  meeting low on output and necessity, that data speaks for itself. Finally, propose a
  <strong>trial period</strong> — cancel for 4 weeks, see what happens. This lowers the perceived
  risk because it's reversible.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Replace, Don't Just Remove</h2>

<p>
  Canceling a meeting without replacing its function creates anxiety. For each meeting you cancel,
  specify what replaces it. A weekly status meeting becomes a Monday async check-in in Slack.
  A biweekly review becomes a shared document with comments. A daily standup becomes a bot-powered
  written update. The replacement should be lower-cost and async where possible.
</p>

<h2>Which Meetings to Target First</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Status update meetings</strong> are almost always the best first target. They're high
  frequency, involve many people, and can be fully replaced with async tools. A 30-minute weekly
  status meeting with 8 people costs about $19,200/year — replacing it with a Slack thread costs
  essentially nothing.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>FYI meetings</strong> where one person presents information to a group are the second
  target. These can be replaced with a recorded video or a written memo that people consume on
  their own time. The information transfer is actually better async because people can pause,
  re-read, and process at their own pace.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Large recurring meetings</strong> with 10+ attendees where most people don't speak are
  the third target. These are almost always carrying passengers who attend out of habit or FOMO
  rather than necessity.
</p>

<h2>After You Cancel</h2>

<p>
  Track the results. Did anything break? Did anyone miss the meeting? Did the async replacement
  work? In most cases, the answer is: nothing broke, a few people missed it for a week, and the
  replacement worked fine. After a month, the cancellation becomes permanent and nobody looks back.
  Calculate your savings with our <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a> and share the results
  with the team — it reinforces the behavior and motivates further optimization.
