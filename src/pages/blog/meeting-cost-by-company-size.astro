<p>
  Meeting costs don't scale linearly with company size — they scale <strong>exponentially</strong>.
  A 100-person company doesn't have 10× the meetings of a 10-person startup. It has closer to 50×,
  because meetings breed meetings: status updates, cross-functional syncs, alignment sessions,
  reviews of reviews. Here's what the numbers look like at every stage.
</p>

<h2>5-Person Startup</h2>

<p>
  At this stage, meetings are lean and justified. Everyone's in the room because everyone needs to be.
  Assuming average founder/early-employee pay of $60,000-$80,000 (~$35-$50/hour fully loaded):
</p>

<p>
  A daily 15-minute standup with all 5 people costs roughly <strong>$10,500-$15,000 per year</strong>.
  A weekly 1-hour planning session costs about <strong>$8,400-$12,000 per year</strong>. Total recurring
  meeting cost at this stage is typically <strong>$20,000-$35,000/year</strong>, or 5-8% of total payroll.
  That's healthy.
</p>

<h2>20-Person Scaleup</h2>

<p>
  This is where meeting bloat begins. You now have 2-3 teams, which means cross-team syncs. Assuming
  average salary of $75,000 (~$47/hour):
</p>

<p>
  Daily standups per team (3 teams × 7 people × 15 min) cost about <strong>$47,500/year</strong>.
  Weekly all-hands (20 people × 30 min) adds <strong>$22,600/year</strong>. Cross-team syncs, 1-on-1s,
  and planning sessions can easily add another <strong>$40,000-$60,000/year</strong>. Total:
  <strong>$100,000-$130,000/year</strong>, or 8-12% of payroll. The inefficiency is starting.
</p>

<h2>100-Person Company</h2>

<p>
  At 100 people, meeting culture is either deliberately managed or it's already out of control.
  Average salary: $80,000 (~$50/hour). The math gets serious:
</p>

<div class="stat-callout">
  <span class="stat-number">$500K - $800K</span>
  <span class="stat-label">Typical annual meeting cost for a 100-person company</span>
</div>

<p>
  The average 100-person company has 15-25 recurring meetings per week plus ad-hoc meetings.
  If the average employee spends 30% of their time in meetings, that's 12 hours per week per person,
  which translates to <strong>$600/week per person</strong> or <strong>$2.88 million in total
  meeting salary</strong> per year. Not all of that is waste — maybe 60-70% of those meetings are
  valuable. But even the "necessary" meetings can often be shortened.
</p>

<h2>500-Person Mid-Market</h2>

<p>
  At this scale, meetings are an organizational system, not just a communication tool. Average salary:
  $85,000 (~$53/hour). The numbers:
</p>

<p>
  With employees spending an average of 33% of their time in meetings, the annual meeting salary cost
  is roughly <strong>$7.5 million</strong>. That's before accounting for opportunity cost. Companies at
  this size typically have meeting archetypes layered on top of each other: team standups, department
  weeklies, cross-functional syncs, steering committees, exec reviews, and all-hands.
</p>

<p>
  The biggest cost driver at this level isn't any single meeting — it's the <strong>cascade effect</strong>.
  A VP attends a strategy meeting, then holds a meeting with their directors to relay information, then
  each director holds a meeting with their teams. One decision creates 10+ meetings.
</p>

<h2>1,000+ Enterprise</h2>

<p>
  At enterprise scale, meeting costs are measured in tens of millions. Average fully-loaded cost:
  $60/hour. If the average employee spends 35% of their time in meetings:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1,000 employees:</strong> ~$17.5 million/year in meeting salary costs. <strong>5,000
  employees:</strong> ~$87 million/year. <strong>10,000 employees:</strong> ~$175 million/year.
</p>

<p>
  At this scale, even a 10% reduction in meeting time saves millions. That's why enterprise companies
  are increasingly investing in async communication tools, meeting-free days, and meeting cost
  tracking — the ROI is enormous.
</p>

<h2>The Pattern</h2>

<p>
  Meeting cost as a percentage of payroll typically follows this curve: 5-8% at startup stage,
  rising to 10-15% as teams form, and stabilizing (or spiraling) at 15-25% for larger companies.
  The companies that keep it closer to 10-15% at scale are the ones that actively manage their
  meeting culture.

  Start with visibility. Use our <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a> to calculate the cost of
  your top 10 recurring meetings. Add them up. Compare the total to what you'd spend on a new hire,
  a tool, or a team offsite. That comparison usually starts the right conversation.
