  title="How Much Does Your Daily Standup Really Cost Per Year?"
  description="Daily standups seem short and harmless. But multiply by 240 working days and the number gets uncomfortable fast."

<p>
  The daily standup is the most common meeting in tech. It's also the meeting people question
  least — "it's only 15 minutes." But 15 minutes × 5 people × 240 working days is
  <strong>300 hours per year</strong>. That's 7.5 full work weeks of collective time.
  Let's look at what that actually costs.
</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>
  For a typical 5-person engineering team with an average fully-loaded cost of $55/hour:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>15 minutes × 5 people × 240 days = 300 hours/year</strong>. At $55/hour, that's
  <strong>$16,500 per year</strong> for one team's standup. If your company has 10 teams doing
  daily standups, that's <strong>$165,000 per year</strong> — the cost of two junior developers.
</p>

<div class="stat-callout">
  <span class="stat-number">$16,500</span>
  <span class="stat-label">Annual cost of a 5-person daily standup at $55/hr average</span>
</div>

<p>
  And that's the optimistic number. In reality, most standups run 20-25 minutes, not 15. People
  arrive late and the meeting starts 3-5 minutes behind. The actual time cost is often 30-40%
  higher than scheduled.
</p>

<h2>When Standups Run Long</h2>

<p>
  A standup that averages 25 minutes instead of 15 costs <strong>$27,500/year</strong> for a 5-person
  team — a 67% increase. The usual culprits: people going into too much detail, solving problems
  in the standup instead of parking them, or the standup becoming a general discussion.
</p>

<p>
  The original purpose of a standup is three questions per person: What did I do yesterday? What am
  I doing today? What's blocking me? At 1-2 minutes per person, a 5-person standup should be done
  in 10 minutes. If it consistently runs longer, the format has drifted.
</p>

<h2>The Real Question: Is It Worth It?</h2>

<p>
  $16,500/year is significant, but the standup might still be worth it if it genuinely prevents
  miscommunication, catches blockers early, and keeps the team aligned. The problem is when the
  standup becomes ritual rather than functional — people attend because they're supposed to,
  not because it changes what they do.
</p>

<p>
  Signs your standup is providing value: blockers get identified and resolved faster, team members
  adjust their work based on what others share, the meeting consistently ends in under 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Signs your standup is a cost center: people zone out while others talk, updates are generic
  ("working on the same thing as yesterday"), no one changes their plan based on the meeting,
  it consistently runs over time.
</p>

<h2>Alternatives That Cost Less</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Async standup bots.</strong> Tools like Geekbot or Standuply post the three standup
  questions in Slack daily. People respond when they're ready. The team gets the same information
  at near-zero meeting cost. Only escalate to a synchronous call when someone is actually blocked.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>3× per week instead of 5×.</strong> Many teams find that Monday-Wednesday-Friday standups
  capture 90% of the value at 60% of the cost. The two "off" days create space for deep work
  and most blockers surface within 24 hours anyway.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Walking standups with no chairs.</strong> If you keep the synchronous format, removing
  chairs (literally) keeps it short. Standing meetings run 25-30% shorter on average according
  to workplace research.
</p>

<h2>Calculate Your Standup Cost</h2>

<p>
  Use our <a href="/">meeting cost calculator</a> to see exactly what your standup costs. Set it to
  your team size, average rate, and actual duration (be honest — time it for a week). Then multiply
  by 240 working days. The yearly number is what you're investing in this daily ritual.
</p>

<p>
  If the number feels right for the value you're getting, keep it. If it doesn't, try one of the
  alternatives for a month and see what happens. Most teams that switch to async standups report
  that nothing broke and they got hours back.
